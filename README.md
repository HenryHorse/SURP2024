# Hello World

This is a simple Hello World program in C++, which prints both Hello World! and the C++ version (which should always be C++20).

If using VS code, use the VS Code run button to compile, and then run via command line using the following line:

```sh
./hello_world
```

Ensure g++ is installed.

Alternatively, you can compile using
```sh
g++ -std=c++20 -g -o hello_world hello_world.cpp
```
